    <h1>Prince Rupert's Cube</h1>
    <div class="origami-grid">

      <p>The Prince Rupert Cube works on the basis that a cube viewed from a corner can have a larger orthographic projection than a square with the same side-length</p>

      <p>To start with I took two <a href="origami.html">Sonobe Cubes</a> and cut half the hole in one.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Sadly, I quickly found that paper was not very well suited to this task and making a 1:1 ratio of inner to outer cube would be extremely difficult with this medium</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Since the advent of 3D printing, the 1:1 model is rendered facile. Here the outer ring is in two parts to reduce the supports necessary, increasing the quality and strength of the print</p>
